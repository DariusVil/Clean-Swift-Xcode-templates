# Clean Swift Xcode Templates

These are Xcode templates for Clean Swift agents based on Raymond Law's ones available [here](https://clean-swift.com/)

# Whats different

* Removed file header license comment section
* Removed everything IB. Targeted to developers who do UI from code
* Style changed to comply with [Wenderlich style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)
* Creates only VC, P, I, R
* Used minimalist approach - no stub template functions and data passing protocols
